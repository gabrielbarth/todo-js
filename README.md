### What could I learn about this simple project?


When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a **DOM (Document Object Model)** of the page.

The incredible news is that we are able to manipulate DOM elements through DOM methods.

For example:

**querySelector()** is a method that returns the first element that matches a specified CSS selector(s) in the document;
<br>
**createElement()** method allows to create an Element Node with the specified name;
<br>
**createTextNode()** method allows to create a Text Node with the specified text;
<br>
**setAttribute()** method adds the specified attribute to an element, and gives it the specified value;
<br>
**appendChild()** method adds a node after the last child node of the specified element node.
<br><br>
These are just a little bit of the Document Object Properties and Methods. We could consulting several others in Javascript documentation.
